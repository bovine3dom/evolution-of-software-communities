Make an adjacency matrix from each month.

The nth column contains the dependents of package n. The nth row contains the dependees.
If a column is empty, that means that project did not have any release this month (or its release had no dependencies). We can't just copy the column from the previous month because it may be a legitimate new release with 0 dependencies where the last month had >0 dependencies.

Anyway, for each month, filter to all packages with months <= m then take the max month:
